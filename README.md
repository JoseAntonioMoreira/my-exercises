Full stack exercises repository

Welcome to my Full stack exercises repository!

This repository contains a collection of exercises that I have worked on, ranging from beginner to advanced levels. 

The purpose of these exercises is to demonstrate my skills and familiarity with core programming concepts, object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving.

This repository contains different types of exercises, including:

Basic syntax: Simple programs to understand variables, loops, conditionals, and more.

Object-Oriented Programming: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

Data Structures: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more.

Algorithms: Sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.

Advanced Topics: Multithreading, file I/O, exception handling, and more.

Each exercise is designed to build on specific concepts that improve problem-solving skills. 

This is an ongoing repository where I plan to continually add more exercises as I continue to explore new concepts and challenges.
